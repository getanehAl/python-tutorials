Python Syntax
Execute Python Syntax
As we learned, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py

Python Indentations
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
Example
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
Example
Comments in Python:
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

Docstrings
Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings.
Docstrings can be one line, or multiline.
Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:
Example
Docstrings are also comments:
"""This is a
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, World!")
