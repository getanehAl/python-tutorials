Python Variables
Creating Variables
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
Example
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). 
Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Remember that variables are case-sensitive

Output Variables
The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:
Example
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:
Example
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)

For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
Example
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

but if you want to combine a string with a number,cast the number to a string using
a str() function.
Example
x = 5 
y = "Hello"
print(str(x) + y)

If you want to display, any string n times, use the below code:
x = 5 
y = "Hello"
print(x * y)
